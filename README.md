# Idea
Implement a platform containing one-click trading strategies across multiple chains so auto-trading get's more exposure to newbies as well

# TODO
- ./src/services/general/chains should only send txn
- txns object should be created and send from inside each service, for eg - swap txn
- token support should go to ./src/constants
- /src/services/general/services/dca should be taking in token and chain as param
- update .env.example
